The settings are grouped into second-level sections:

  Enables shared behaviors such as download archive.
- `video_config`
  Contains `yt-dlp` related options like download folders, cookies, proxy, and separate-folder layout.

  Contains local image download path plus `gallery-dl` / `ktoolbox` config and cookies files.
- `rclone_config`
  Contains shared upload switch, remote name, video remote folders, and image remote folder.

## Usage

### Basic Download

```
/video <url>
```

Example:
```
/video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx
```

### Audio Download

```
/audio <url>
```

### Image Download

```
/image <url>
```

Behavior:
- Kemono URLs use `ktoolbox`
- Other supported image/gallery URLs use `gallery-dl`
- Local mode saves to `image_download_folder`
- rclone mode downloads to a temp directory and uploads the whole tree to `image_rclone_folder`, preserving nested paths such as `author/platform/...`

### Telegram File Download

```
/video <filename>
```

Then upload a file in Telegram. The plugin will download the file to the selected directory.

### Interactive Selection

After sending a URL, you can:
1. Reply with a number (1, 2, 3...) to select a download directory
2. Reply "存档" to toggle archive option
3. Reply "代理" to toggle proxy option
4. Reply "独立文件夹" to toggle per-video folder layout
5. Reply "视频" to download video
6. Reply "音频" to download audio only
7. Reply "开始" to download using the default mode

On Telegram, the inline keyboard message will refresh the current folder and option summary after each click so the visible selection marker stays in sync with the effective download settings.
